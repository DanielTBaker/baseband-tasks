0.2 (unreleased)
================

This release will depend on ``baseband`` 4.0 as one can then assume
(and document) the existence of ``baseband.tasks``.


0.1.1 (2020-07-19)
==================

Update that includes the DOI and for which the README.txt is clean
enough for ``twine``.


0.1 (2020-07-19)
================

Initial release.  Project renamed from original ``scintillometry``,
but similar in that the documentation still suggests that tasks be
imported from the various modules in ``baseband_tasks``, which is
the only way they can be used for ``baseband`` prior to 4.0.
