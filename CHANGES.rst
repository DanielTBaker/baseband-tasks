0.1 (2020-07-19)
================

Initial release.  Project renamed from original ``scintillometry``,
but similar in that the documentation still suggests that tasks be
imported from the various modules in ``baseband_tasks``, which is
the only way they can be used for ``baseband`` prior to 4.0.

There will be a new version soon after this one which will depend on
``baseband`` 4.0 as one can then assume (and document) the existence
of ``baseband.tasks``.
